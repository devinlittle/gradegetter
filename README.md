# Grade Getter

**Ts pulls your grades straight from Schoology, no clicking around, no API access required .**

I hate schoology sm its so slow and the UI is soo outdated, slow, and their servers are stright ass.

## How to Run It

### 1. Grab your session token

Slide into your browser's dev tools -> cookies -> copy your `SESS9xxxx...` token.  
![alt text](cookies.png)

_(dont leak it bruh)_

Have it formated like so "<ins>SESS9</ins>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=BXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

make sure to find the SESS9 cuz there are multiple session cookies /\

> have it formated like this, NAME=VALUE

### 2. Run the code:

```bash
cargo run --release -- your_token_here
```

### What This Does

* Pulls grading period tokens

* Selects the grading quarter (Q1â€“Q4)

* Grabs your classes + final grades

* Parses the grades into clean JSON

* Saves the raw HTML in index.html just in case

### Function Rundown

| Function                      | funtion description                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fetch_export_form_tokens()`  | Grabs the form tokens/build_id Schoology finna gonna hide         |
| `select_grade_period()`       | Picks the grading quarter (change the IDs)                        |
| `fetch_final_grades_export()` | Pulls that grade HTML after selecting your classes                |
| `parse_grades_html()`         | Parses the mess into a usable `HashMap<String, Vec<Option<f32>>>` |
